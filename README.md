# My Personal Website
This repository contains the source code for my personal website. It
was written with a combination of NextJS, SASS, and React Server Components.
Because the is hosted on GitHub Pages, the website is static and has no server-side 
functionality. 

## Hello World!
I am Ryan O'Connor, a senior college student majoring in Computer 
Science and looking to get a career in fullstack web development
and mobile development!
