# My Personal Website
This repository contains the source code for my personal website.

## Hello World!
I am Ryan O'Connor, a senior college student majoring in Computer 
Science and looking to get a career in fullstack web development
and mobile development!


## Website Goals

### Goals Before Publishing to GitHub
* Write some posts!
* Add Modal Image viewer
* Add Site Map to Footer so that user can still navigate through website on mobile without Javascript


### Optional Features
* Generate a smaller version of each image so that loading them
is faster when being displayed in small components.
* Use CSS to create toolbox instead of using SVG so that
wood-theme SASS partial can be used on it.
* Add a second row to the PageNavigator component that
allows the user to skip to first and last pages.
* Allow Frame component to use different wood backgrounds instead
of just one.
