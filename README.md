# My Personal Website
This repository hosts my personal website.

## Hello World!
I am Ryan O'Connor, a senior college student majoring in Computer 
Science and looking to get a career in fullstack web development
and mobile development!

## Goals Before Publishing to GitHub
* Refine the blog post page
* Use different cards for showing each post.
* Add Site Map to Footer
* Write some posts!

## Optional Features
* Use CSS to create toolbox instead of using SVG so that
wood-theme SASS partial can be used on it.
* Add a second row to the PageNavigator component that
allows the user to skip to first and last pages.
* Allow Frame component to use different wood backgrounds instead
of just one.
* Make AJAX requests to static server using Javascript for
lazy-loading large images.

## Issues
* Buttons in UI look way too much like Frame captions, headings, and tags. Either make buttons stand out more or redesign the
heading, captions, and tags.
