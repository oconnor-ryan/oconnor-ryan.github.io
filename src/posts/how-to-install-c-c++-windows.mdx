title: How To Install C/C++ Compiler on Windows (Without All The Bloat)
description: >-
  A guide on how to install a C/C++ compiler for Windows without using
  the resource-heavy Visual Studio or the hard-to-use MSYS2 toolchain.
  This is targeted toward new programmers who want to learn C/C++ as their
  first language.

## The Simplest Toolchain To Install A C/C++ Compiler
Sadly, you cannot ONLY install a C/C++ compiler on Windows. You must use
a toolchain, which can be very frustrating because you will need to first 
learn how to use the toolchain before you even get to install the C/C++
compiler. That was the case for MSYS2 when I first tried it out many years ago.
It required me to learn how to use the pacman package manager for me to 
even install the MingGW GCC compiler for Windows. For a newer programmer who's 
only experience with programming was a little bit of Java, this was overwelming.

Visual Studio is somewhat more user-friendly, since everything is displayed in
a GUI. However, it is a very large and complex program that has a lot of tools that
a newer programmer will never use. Visual Studio on my computer is over 30 GB and runs 
quite slow when booting.

For the new programmer, I recommend that you download either the LLVM 
project or MingGW-w64.

LLVM solves both problems by just being a compiler. While it can 
compile a few more languages other than C/C++ and can be configured 
to work with other languages (or your own language), it is still a 
good C/C++ compiler that does not take up too much space. LLVM 
comes with the Clang and Clang++ front-end tools for C and C++, respectively.
When you use the Clang or Clang++ commands, it invokes the LLVM compiler to 
take your C/C++ code and convert it into object and machine code.
In addition, these compilers are automatically put in the $PATH so that
new programmers can just install LLVM and start using the Clang compiler 
immediately. 

MingGW-w64 is another solid option I would recommend. It is a fork of the 
MingGW project, which is a Windows port of the GCC compiler, the official 
compiler for Linux. Like LLVM, it can compile more than C/C++. Usually, 
MingGW-w64 is bundled in larger toolsets like MSYS2 and Cygwin. However, 
for newer programmers who just want to learn C, using those tools can be 
overwhelming. Luckily, MingGW-w64 can be installed 
by itself through WinLibs.com. Note that when installing MingGW-64, some 
versions of it come bundled with other tools, such as LLVM. Select the option 
that does not use LLVM to safe space.

Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) Compiler can also be installed as a standalone 
package via the Build Tools for Visual Studio installer without installing the entirty of Visual Studio. 
In addition, it will also allow you to 
select which tools you want. For C/C++ development, the only tool you'll need 
is the Desktop Development with C++ tool.
