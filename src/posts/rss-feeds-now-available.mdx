## What's An RSS Feed?
An RSS feed is basically a file that a website provides that allows you
to be notified when a website gets new content without periodically 
checking that site to see what has changed. It was primarily used back
in the early 2000s so that users can receive the latest posts, news, and
other content from multiple websites. Nowadays, however, the popularity
of RSS feeds has greatly declined due to the rise of social media applications
and email subscriptions, according to [POWR](https://blog.powr.io/are-rss-feeds-still-being-used)<sup id="reference-index1"><a href="./#reference1">[1]</a></sup>.
Think about it, on social media apps, you just need to follow or subscribe
to your favorite content creaters and you'll get notified when they post
new stuff. And when you want to get the latest news from a certain website, 
you generally give them your email.

## Why Should I Use An RSS Feed If It's So Old?
Despite it being an very old technology that has not been updated in 14 years,
it offers advantages that no other application or tool can provide.

### Complete Control Over What You Want To See
When you use a social media application, the content you view is limited
to whatever is available on that platform. For example, there is no
native support for your YouTube account to follow a Facebook account 
and vise-versa. In addition, you may only want to see a subset of the 
content posted by the accounts you follow. Not all social media accounts 
provide the option to filter posts and videos based on both the author and
topics that those posts relate to. 

With RSS feeds, you don't have to worry about those limitations. You can 
subscribe to the RSS feeds of any website on the internet that provides them.
Some websites may even create separate RSS feeds for each user so that you 
can pick who you want to follow. In addition, most RSS feed readers allow you
to filter each individual feed using keywords and topics, allowing you to only
view the content you actually want to see from each user you follow.

(Show flow of content for each type of update (Social Media, RSS, Email Subscription))

### Anonymity
For users who don't like the idea of providing their email to websites to
receive updates or creating an account with their personal information on
a social media app, RSS feeds are perfect for you. All RSS feeds are nothing
more than a data file that gets updated by the website that provides it when
new content is posted. The only thing that an RSS feed reader does is ask the
websites you subscribed to for their RSS feed files via a HTTP request. Once your feed reader gets
these files, it tells you what content from the new feed file is different from
the old feed file you got when you first subscribed to those websites. You 
don't need to give out your personal information or email to receive 
updates from those websites. Assuming that you RSS feed reader does not require
you to make any online accounts, your anonymity is further improved by not 
needing to create a social media account or email account.

## How Does An RSS Feed Work?
First of all, the website you want to subscribe to must provide a RSS file.
Without that file, you cannot subscribe to that website.

This RSS file is a data file that stores basic information about the website, 
such as its URL, the date of the RSS file's most recent update, and, most 
importantly, a record of every single post made by the website.

<Frame src="/assets/images/blog/rss-example.png" caption="A snippet of my website's RSS file." useModal={true} css={{width: '100%', maxWidth: '700px', margin: 'auto'}}/>

Each record will include metadata about a post, such as its title, author, and tags.
Some websites may even include its entire article in that record so you don't 
even need to visit the website to read the articles that are posted.

By itself, this RSS file is not very useful to you. In order to fully leverage
the capabilities of RSS I stated above, you will need to download a trusted RSS feed
reader application. The read magic happens when you tell your RSS reader to
subscribe to the RSS feed of a certain website. The RSS reader will send an
HTTP request to download the RSS feed file from the website. It will then 
display each post in that RSS file into a nicely formatted inbox on your computer.
When the website you subscribed to makes a new post, they will update their own RSS
file with data about the new post. When you reopen your RSS reader or tell it to update
its feed, it will redownload the new RSS file from the website and check to see if
it has any new posts. If there are new posts, those posts will be displayed on 
the inbox of your RSS reader.

If you don't want to view certain posts, most RSS readers will allow you
to set up filters that exclude certain posts from websites based on the 
keywords, phrases, and tags you specify.

As you can see, it's a suprisingly simple and effective solution to automatically
retrieve and filter new content from multiple websites, all without needing an
email address or account.

## How Do I Use An RSS Feed Reader?
How you use your RSS Reader will depend on which one you download. You can obtain
an RSS reader through browser extensions, standalone apps, or through other
websites. In this example, I will show you how to use Feedbro, which is a free browser
extension for both Firefox and Google Chrome. To use it:

### Subscribing to RSS Feeds
Navigate to the website you want to subscribe to and open the Feedbro extension:

<Frame src="/assets/images/blog/rss-step1.png" useModal={true} css={{width: '100%', maxWidth: '700px', margin: 'auto'}}/>


Click on 'Find Feeds In Current Tab'. 

If no options are displayed, the 
website either does not have an RSS file or it did not properly link the RSS
file location. If you want to check for this file, you can look for the <img src="/assets/images/blog/rss-feed.png" style={{width: '20px', height: '20px', maxWidth: '20px', margin: 0, borderRadius: 0, display: 'inline'}}/> symbol
or a hyperlink called 'RSS Feed'. Click on this link or icon to see the raw 
RSS file, then open the Feedbro extension and click on 'Find Feeds In Current Tab'

<Frame src="/assets/images/blog/rss-step2.png" useModal={true} css={{width: '100%', maxWidth: '700px', margin: 'auto'}}/>


You may see multiple feeds depending on whether the website makes separate
feeds for each topic and/or the type of RSS file they support. Feedbro can
read from both RSS and Atom Feed files, but not JSON Feed files. 

Select the feed(s) you want to follow and hit 'Subscribe':

<Frame src="/assets/images/blog/rss-step3.png" useModal={true} css={{width: '100%', maxWidth: '700px', margin: 'auto'}}/>


Once you've successfully subscribed to that feed, select the 'Open Feed Reader'
option to view your inbox.

<Frame src="/assets/images/blog/rss-step4.png" useModal={true} css={{width: '100%', maxWidth: '700px', margin: 'auto'}}/>

You can now see a snippet of all the posts of the website you subscribed to.
If you want to view a post on the website, just click the title of the
post to be redirected to the website. 


### Filtering Posts
In this section, I'll show you how to filter and tag the posts you subscribed to see. 
As an example, I'll show you how to hide all posts that don't include
the word "blog" and insert an 'HTML' tag into all posts that contain the word
'HTML' inside a specific website.

Open the Feedbro extension and select the 'Open Feed Reader' option to view the
reader.

On the left sidebar, select the 'Rules' option:

<Frame src="/assets/images/blog/rss-filter1.png" useModal={true} css={{width: '100%', maxWidth: '700px', margin: 'auto'}}/>


On the main window under the 'No defined rules yet' text, click 'Add Rule'.

We will first create a rule to hide all posts from my website where 
there word 'blog' is not in my title or description.

Below is a picture of how I configured this rule:

<Frame src="/assets/images/blog/rss-filter2.png" useModal={true} css={{width: '100%', maxWidth: '700px', margin: 'auto'}}/>

Let me break down this form for you:

1. Leave the 'Enabled' and 'Fallthrough' checkboxes checked.
2. In the two dropdown menus by the When option, select 
"New article arrives" in "feed" and then select the feed you want to filter.
This means that when a new article is posted, the rule will check the
conditions below and, if the condition is true, perform an action.
3. In the match section, select the 'All Conditions' option from the dropdown.
This means that all conditions must be true before the action specified later
in the rule is performed.
4. Press 'Add Condition' to add more conditions.
5. In the first condition, use the dropdown to form the sentence: "Content doesn't contain text blog using case-insensive matching"
This means that if the description of a post does not contain the string
"blog", whether capitalized or not, then apply the actions specified.
6. Finally, you will need to add an action that occurs when one of those
conditions is true. Click 'Add Action' and select 'Delete Article'.

Here is a screenshot of the entire rule for adding the 'HTML' tag to
all posts that have the word HTML in it's title or description:

<Frame src="/assets/images/blog/rss-filter3.png" useModal={true} css={{width: '100%', maxWidth: '700px', margin: 'auto'}}/>

Here is the result of these 2 rules added to my website.

<Frame src="/assets/images/blog/rss-filter4.png" useModal={true} css={{width: '100%', maxWidth: '700px', margin: 'auto'}}/>


My 8 posts got filtered out into 4 posts that contain the word 'Blog' in 
them and the 2 posts that mention 'HTML' have an 'HTML' tag.
