  When the user has a wide screen (>900px), the full navbar is visible.

  There are only 2 layers to worry about for the z-index:

  z-index: 1
    This is the drawerTopContainer, which sits under all other navbar elements
    and forms the background of the navbar.
  
  z-index: 2
    The nav and logo elements are on this layer and appear above the drawerTopContainer.
    
  When the screen size is reduced to 768px or less, the nav element will
  get moved to z-index: 0 so that it can serve as a dropdown menu for mobile users.

  This is only for when the viewport width is less than 768px:

  The navbar can be split into 3 layers on the z-axis:

  * z-index: 0 (Bottom layer)
    The nav element is at this layer when its dropdown is expanded.
    

  * z-index: 1 (Middle layer)
    These elements appear on top of the bottom layer and cover up
    the elements below it.
    - The drawerTopContainer is drawn over the nav element so that 
    the user cannot see that the nav elements is positioned directly
    under the drawerTopContainer. Once the nav element extends down,
    the nav container does not block the drawerTopContainer, giving
    the illusion of opening a drawer.

  * z-index 2 (Top layer)
    The logo and hamburger menu appear on top of all other navbar elements
    since they must be visible to the user at all times.

  When the header is not given a .dropdown class, only Layers
  1 and 2 are visible. The nav element at Layer 0 is positioned offscreen
  above the navbar.

  When the header is given a .dropdown class, the nav element at Layer 0
  moves down until the top of the container reaches the bottom of the drawetTopContainer.
